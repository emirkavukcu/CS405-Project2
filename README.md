I did the bonus task 4 and added an additional slider to control the blending factor value. For this to work correctly, you should first upload the first texture to the
"texture image" upload, then upload the second texture to "second texture image" upload. Then you can toggle
the blend factor slider to try different blendings
between texture 1 and texture 2.

I also made the landscape view of the page same as the
portrait view, that is, the controls are under the canvas
instead of being at the right.
